Dashboard that displays current events, news, time and weather of SF

**ONGOING**

A learning project on APIs.

Initial concept is four Bootstrap containers in which there is SF's real time down to the second, the weather conditions from Open Weather API, 
events from the Eventbrite API, and news from various outlets about SF using NewsAPI.


Goals after finishing Minimum Viable Product:
-make this dashboard work for wherever your computer is (location based) or whatever user input is (i.e. zipcode)
-turn all four real-time data points into an API
